Scenario 1:
Inheritance is not needed since mode of travel
can be a separate field in the ticket class.
Additionally, all travel types are distinct.
Therefore, all objects will have the same fields
(char mode of travel, String source, String destination,
String date and time, String ticket details, 
char travel class type). One class can be created 
from this information and ticket price can be found.

Scenario 2:
All classes could share a superclass with a 
list of destinations, although one may or may not
want to since a one way taxi only has one designation.
Assuming that this wouldn't be ideal. One class
would be specific to one way tickets. This class
would include a destination, kilometers traveled and 
a method to return the price - kilometers * 2. 
One day and package tickets could share a superclass
with number of people and destinations. One day
tickets would have a method that multiples the
per person rate with the number of people to
get the rate and the bus number. Package tickets 
would have the travel schedule and its own function
to calculate and return price.
